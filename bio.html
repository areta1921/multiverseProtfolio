               <p>The first step in writing a short bio is deciding on a voice. For our purposes, choosing a voice involves deciding whether you are writing in the first or third person. Writing in the first person means using the words "I" and "me", while writing in the third person means using your name.

                For instance, if you are writing a slightly informal bio for your Twitter profile, first-person would probably be the best fit. However, if you are adding a bio to your company page and all your coworkers used third-person in their paragraphs, you should certainly follow suit. Your voice should accurately represent who you are as a person, so you might also adjust your voice to be more professional, witty, friendly or reserved, depending on your personality.
                
                2. State your name and job title
                In the first sentence of your short bio, you will need to give your name and your current job title. For example, your bio might begin with "Sarah Hayes is the Senior Marketing Director for Blooming Street Creative". If you are in the process of finding a job, you can list your most recent title or your college major. This might look something like "My name is John Grayson and I am a recent college graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Web Design and Development".
                
                3. State your philosophy
                After introducing yourself, you may want to relate your personal or professional mission statement. This should answer the question, "Why do you do what you do?". Your personal philosophy may involve serving others, providing for your family or making the most of your opportunities. Your professional philosophy could relate to expanding your expertise, contributing to society or learning new skills. Your philosophy should give your reader an accurate idea of what matters the most to you.

                4. Share your accomplishments
                Writing a short bio is similar to writing a resume in that you will want to highlight your professional accomplishments. However, you will need to describe them in a way that any reader can understand. Instead of describing yourself as a "Carthage award-winning graphic artist," you might write that you are a "multi-talented graphic artist who won the 2019 Carthage Award for artistic excellence and innovation." Even if your reader is not familiar with your specific industry's awards, they will likely respond well to positive keywords like "innovation."
